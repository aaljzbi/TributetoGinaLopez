    </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Regina Paz "Gina" La'O López (December 27, 1953 – August 19, 2019) was a Filipino environmentalist and philanthropist who served as the Chairperson of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission. 
    López was the daughter of ABS-CBN Chairman Emeritus Eugenio López, Jr. of Iloilo and Conchita La'O of Manila. She has six siblings including ABS-CBN Chairman Eugenio López III. 
    She went to Assumption College and Newton College of the Sacred Heart in Boston. She has a Master’s Degree in Development Management from the Asian Institute of 
    Management and a Doctorate Degree in Humanities, Honoris Causa from the Ateneo de Naga University and another Doctorate Degree in Humane Letters, Honoris Causa from the Palawan State University.
    <br><br>
    She was the Chairperson of the ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya Foundation Inc., the
    Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission, and is the Vice Chairperson of Bayan Academy.
    She was known to be a strong advocate of children and education, the environment and its protection,
    as well as health and wellness.
    <br><br> 
    As an advocate of children, she spearheaded the country’s first media-based hotline, Bantay Bata
    163. Bantay Bata 163 is a child welfare program that protects disadvantaged and at-risk children. In
    1997, Bantay Bata was awarded the United Nations Grand Awardee for Excellence besting 187
    countries from all over the world.
    <br><br> 
    For education, she produced an educational television show on science, math, values, history, and
    English for elementary students. The success of Sineskwela was recognized by honoring Lopez
    with the Unesco Kalinga Award – the first Southeast Asian to earn such a distinction.
    <br><br> 
    Lopez was also at the forefront of environmental protection and conservation.
    In her fight to protect the environment, she launched a 10 million signature campaign to say in one
    loud voice that key biodiversity areas must be protected and not be ravaged by mining.
    Since then, Bantay Kalikasan’s thrust has been environmental education through the promotion of
    ecotourism. Her goal was to be able to imprint in the hearts and minds of Filipinos the mandate of
    taking care of the environment which in turn will lead to sustainable and and inclusive growth. The
    foundation is currently present in 13 provinces, 33 municipalities, and has helped over 140 people’s
    organizations across the country. 
    She was the second member of President Rodrigo Duterte's cabinet to be rejected by the Commission on Appointments having followed in the booted footsteps of former Department of Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay. 
    <br><br>
    Lopez was earlier diagnosed with Brain Cancer. She died of multiple organ failure related to the disease at Makati Medical Center on August 19, 2019.
